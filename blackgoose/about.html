<h2>About Black Goose Bistro</h2>

<p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself.
 In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. 
 <em>Bon Appetit!</em>

 The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources.
 One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
